# Credits and Attributions

The C exercises in this repository were created and reworked while following the courses in the **C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate** program, offered by Dartmouth College and Institut Mines-Télécom (IMT) through the edX platform.

This excellent program provides the foundation for the code in this tutorial. Full credit for the original concepts and problems goes to the creators of the program.
